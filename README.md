# My Portfolio Website 💻✨

Welcome to my first personal portfolio website! This project showcases my journey as a 3rd-year BSIT student and demonstrates my skills in web development, design, and modern JavaScript frameworks.

### About This Project
This website serves as my digital presence where I highlight my projects, skills, and experiences in the field of Information Technology. It’s built with modern web technologies to ensure a fast, responsive, and visually appealing experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
